Overview
========

This is a tool to obtain the best focus from a series of images obtained at
different focus values. It works for imaging and for spectroscopy.

This tool requires python `3.6` at least to work. It will not install with `3.5`.

We recommend using `astroconda <https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ since it is easier.
